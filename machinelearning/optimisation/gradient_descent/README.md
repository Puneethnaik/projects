<h1> Gradient Descent Algorithm </h1>

The following files in this directory are my versions of the gradient descent algorithm from scratch in python. <br>
It was really fun to make<br>

<h3> File decomposition </h3>
there are currently 3 files in the directory 
1. one jupyter notebook(.ipynb extension) 
2. python scripts

1. The jupyter notebook is an interactive way to understand the algorithm. I will include a lot of information. So hold on for more updates :).
2. There are 2 scripts gradient_descent.py and gradient_descent_test.py. gradient_descent.py includes the class. I have wrapped the logic into a neat class which can be used afterwards<br>
    gradient_descent_test.py is used to just test whether the algorithm is working right or not...



<h1> Final Note </h1>
My plan is to create a machine learning library from scratch. This way i can learn a lot about how machine learning algorithms work under the hood.<br>
This goes a lot towards not considering machine learning algorithms as a black box. 

<h6> Any feedback is appreciated. And thanks for using it... </h6>
